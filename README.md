# `üìö` Road2C
**Road2C** is a project to keep track of my C learning journey.
It contains a variety of simple and advanced programs that cover specific topics related to the **C** language. 
For the sake of clarity, they are sorted into different folders.<br>
- This repository also contains solutions to exercises from [learn-c](https://learn-c.org).

1. [Hello World in C](hello-00)
2. [Types](types-01)
3. [Conditions](conditions-02)
4. [Loops](loops-03)
5. [Functions](functions-04)
5. [Static Variables](static-05)
6. [Pointers](pointers-06)
7. [Structs](structs-07)
8. [Arguments by reference](functions-04/arguments_by_reference-08/)
## ToDo

- [ ] Explain each topic covered in the repository (besides plain code).

## `‚ö†Ô∏è` Warning
This resource represents my road from beginner to hopefully advanced **C** programming. <br>
Since I am still a beginner, please note that some programs/comments I make are not 100% accurate. <br> 
For now, I won't recommend this as a *good* resource although I hope this changes soon.
